Multi-pass approach to implementing a UI from designs.

- Start with installing addons we're going to use
- Paste link tag to shoelace
- Generate a few routes and some components
- Invoke the components in the various templates without implementing them
- Start from the application.hbs, and work kind of top-down, left-right for implementation each component. 
  - Only markup and CSS
  - Logic / JS will come later.
    - this will be the bulk of the tutorial
  - Since the dropdown is a crucial part to even seeing some of the markup, do we talk about that as we get to it?
